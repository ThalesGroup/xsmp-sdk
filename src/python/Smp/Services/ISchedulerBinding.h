An immediate event is an event that will be added as a simulation time event (with simulation delta time of 0) at the front of the event queue. As such, it will be executed when the scheduler processes its simulation time events again, but not immediately in the call to AddImmediateEvent().
When the simulator is in Standby state, simulation time does not progress, and simulation time events (including immediate events) are not processed.
